.TH MOTEREAD 1
.SH NAME
moteread \- gather results from a base station
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B db
[
.BI -d " serial device"
]
.I " results directory"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Moteread
records decibel levels of a set of motes fitted with a microphone. Typically
the motes send their data to a base station which is connected via a serial line to the
host computer. The
.B -d
option selects the serial device to use (/dev/eia0 by default). Typical
arguments might be /dev/eia1, eia1 or even 1 for brevity.
.PP
.B Moteread
expects to read packets from the base station through the serial device. A packet consists
of a 2 byte synchronization integer, a 2 byte mote identification number, a 2 byte time
stamp and a sequence of recorded decibel values (currently 2). Values are in big-endian
order.
.PP
For each mote id,
.B moteread
writes the results to a file of the form <moteid.db> in the given results directory.
Each file consists of a 4 byte
start time in seconds followed by a series of records. Each record consists of a 2 byte
time offset in seconds and a series of decibel values (currently 2) taken at certain
intervals (currently 1 second) from that time offset. Values are in little-endian
order.
