.TH SPECTRUM 1
.SH NAME
spectrum \- display of power spectrum
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B spectrum
[
.BI -d " serial device"
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Spectrum
displays the power spectrum and current decibel level as recorded by
a mote fitted with a microphone. These measurements can be sent
directly over a serial line connected to the mote itself or over a
serial line connected to a base station that is receiving the
measurements from the mote by radio for instance. The
.B -d
option selects the serial device to use (/dev/eia0 by default). Typical
arguments might be /dev/eia1, eia1 or even 1 for brevity.
.PP
.B Spectrum
expects to read a packet of data sent either almost continuously
or every few seconds through the serial device. This packet consists of
a 4 byte synchronization integer, then 129 4 byte integers giving
the power values in each of the frequency bins which range from
0 Hz to around 18KHz, then another 2 byte synchronization integer
and finally a 1 byte decibel value. Values are in big-endian order.
.PP
.B Spectrum
displays two windows. The first shows the power spectrum at
a given moment. The scale of the vertical axis can be adjusted
by moving the slider on the left hand side of the window. The
minimum Db level so far, the current Db level and the maximum
Db level so far are shown at the top of the window and a more
visual recording of these on the right hand side of the window.
The second window records past decibel readings. The vertical
scale ranges from 40 dB to 100 dB here.
