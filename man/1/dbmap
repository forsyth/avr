.TH DBMAP 1
.SH NAME
dbmap \- decibel mapping
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dbmap
[
.I " map directory"
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Dbmap
displays a map of a region (currently York) and, given a series of mote locations
and decibel measurements, will display an interpolated decibel map of the
area for any given time during the span of the measurements. Typically a
series of motes would measure sound levels over a certain period and then
.B dbmap
might be used to display the colour coded sound levels over time.
.PP
.B dbmap
first reads the decibel measurement files from the given map directory
(default york). This directory contains files of the form <moteid>.db, one
file per mote used in a typical experiment. These files are created by the
base station during the experiment. A typical file consists of a 4 byte
start time in seconds followed by a series of records. Each record consists of a 2 byte
time offset in seconds and a series of decibel values (currently 2) taken at certain
intervals (currently 1 second) from that time offset. Values are in little-endian
order.
.PP
It then reads a file containing the locations of the motes during the experiment.
This file consists of a series of lines, each one containg a mote id followed by
white space and then it's coordinates in either OS grid form or latitude/longitude
form. See
.B geodesy (2)
for the string formats allowed here.
.PP
A map of the region is displayed with the motes shown as black rectangles.
At the highest magnification, the ids of the motes are shown next to the black
rectangle.
To zoom into a particular area, either select a point with button 1 and select
the zoomin option or simply double click with button 1 on the area of interest.
To zoom back out, either select the zoomout option or double click with
button 3. To move to another area of the map not on the display, simply
move the mouse with button 1 down. To show the decibel map, choose
the 'dbmap' option or press button 2. To select a particular time during the
experiment, use the slider at the top of the display. As the mouse is moved
over the map, latitude/longitude, OS grid coordinates and decibel values are
shown for the point under the mouse.
.PP
Each actual and interpolated decibel value is coloured as follows :
white(0 db), light green(<35 dB), green(<40 dB), dark green(<45 dB),
yellow(<50dB), ochre(<55dB), orange(<60dB), cinnabar(<65dB),
carmine(<70dB), lilac red(<75dB), blue(<80dB), dark blue(<85 dB),
black(>=85 dB).
