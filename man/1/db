.SH NAME
db \- display of decibel levels
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B db
[
.BI -d " serial device"
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Db
displays the recorded decibel levels of a set of motes fitted with a microphone. Typically
the motes send their data to a base station which is connected via a serial line to the
host computer. The
.B -d
option selects the serial device to use (/dev/eia0 by default). Typical
arguments might be /dev/eia1, eia1 or even 1 for brevity.
.PP
.B Db
expects to read packets from the base station through the serial device. A packet consists
of a 2 byte synchronization integer, a 2 byte mote identification number, a 2 byte time
stamp and a sequence of recorded decibel values (currently 2). Values are in big-endian
order.
.PP
.B Db
displays a window for each mote it encounters. The mote id appears in the title of the
window. This display shows the sequence of decibel readings on a vertical scale of
40 dB to 100 dB.
